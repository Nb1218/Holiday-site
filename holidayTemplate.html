  <h4>About the Holiday </h4>
  <p>I  am Jewish and during the winter time I would celebrate Chanukkiah. Chanukkiah  which is the Jewish holiday celebrating the of the oilÂ  lamp that was only supposed to last for one  day lasting for eight. Chanukkiah is not an extremely important holiday in the  Jewish Faith but is fun to celebrate. </p>

  <h4>My Memories </h4>
  <p>my  memories of the holiday season are that of watching and plying in snow and the  smell of pine trees. Also being told the story of the holiday and the food are  very instrumental to my memories of the season. But the thing that most makes  me remember the season was the candles and I enjoyed watching the candles  flicker down and eventually go out.</p>
